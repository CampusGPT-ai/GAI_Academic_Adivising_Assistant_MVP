# One-Stop Academic Advising Assistant by Campus Evolve 
Campus Evolve is partnering with Axim Collaborative on an exciting new project aimed at bringing the power of generative AI to higher education academic advising.  The purpose of this repository is to share code and implementation instructions for an AI academic adivising assistant that combines Retrieval Augmented Generation with Large Language Model Integration to allow universities to implement an online assistant for one-stop advising:

## The Problem
Academic Advising is a critical service offered to students aimed at helping the successfully navigate the financial, academic and social complexities that are part of the education process.  Yet, roughly 50% of students are unaware of most major student services at their institution and only around 20% utilize those services apart from academic advising (Source: Tyton Partners, “Listening to Learners: Increasing Belonging in and out of the Classroom” 2023​) 

### Advising Gap
​​The ratio of students to advisors is 296:1 in most US colleges, making it impossible for students to get the personalized advice and support they need.

### Student Challenges 
The most common causes of student drop-out in higher education are financial issues, academic mis-alignment, and outside pressures such as family, work, and health. The most challenged students are often the ones who don’t know where to go for help and don’t make use of advising and support services

### Advisor Challenges
Advisors must navigate a labyrinth of degree program requirements, student records, financial aid, and course credits. The time spent answering logistical questions hinders advisors from more holistic discussions.

### Drop Out Costs
When students drop out, colleges face reduced public funding, lower tuition fees, higher recruitment costs, and many more challenges, creating a cycle of decline
